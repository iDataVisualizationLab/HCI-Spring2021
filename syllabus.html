<ol type="a"> 
<li style="margin-left: 30px">       
    If Texas Tech University campus operations are required to change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. Should that be necessary, students will need to have access to a webcam and microphone for remote delivery of the class. Additionally, students will need to have access to (here, IoRs should list any specific software or equipment requirements that students would need for online delivery of this course):
      <ul>
      <li style="margin-left: 30px">
    Laptop: A laptop that meets the laptop requirements of the Whitacre College of Engineering found at https://www.depts.ttu.edu/coe/dean/engineeringitservices/buyingtherightcomputer.php
      </li>
      <li style="margin-left: 30px">
    Proctorio: All students must review the syllabus and the requirements including the online terms and video testing requirements to determine if they wish to remain in the course. Enrollment in the course is an agreement to abide by and accept all terms. Any student may elect to drop or withdraw from this course before the end of the drop/add period. Online exams and quizzes within this course may require online proctoring. Therefore, students will be required to have a webcam (USB or internal) with a microphone when taking an exam or quiz. Students understand that this remote recording device is purchased and controlled by the student and that recordings from any private residence must be done with the permission of any person residing in the residence. To avoid any concerns in this regard, students should select private spaces for the testing. The University library and other academic sites at the University offer secure private settings for recordings and students with concerns may discuss location of an appropriate space for the recordings with their instructor or advisor. Students must ensure that any recordings do not invade any third party privacy rights and accept all responsibility and liability for violations of any third party privacy concerns. Setup information will be provided prior to taking the proctored exam. For additional information about online proctoring, you can visit the online proctoring student FAQ.
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>  
<li style="margin-left: 30px">
Policy on absences resulting from illness (see Attachment A). Anticipate that some students may have extended absences. To avoid students feeling compelled to attend in-person class periods when having symptoms or feeling unwell, a standard policy is provided that holds students harmless for illness-related absences. This policy only dictates how absences will be counted. The work/exam makeup policy is up to each individual professor/instructor (IoR should include how they will handle makeup work).
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 30px">
In the event a class member has a positive case. The TTU System and University-wide guidance is given as a flowchart titled “COVID-19 Positive Student Test Notification and Protocol” at the end of this syllabus. Be prepared to review protocol and point students to sources of information so they will know what to expect should a member of the class have a positive case of COVID-19.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 30px">
d. Requesting accommodations as a result of personal health concerns. Keep in mind the instructor must review the following criteria when considering an accommodation for a student: (1) whether the requested accommodation would make a substantive alteration of the course material or objectives; (2) whether the accommodation provides an equally effective alternative to the original objectives or activities of the class; and (3) whether the accommodation can be uniformly applied should more than one student request it. If the instructor can satisfactorily address these three requirements for accommodation, and is comfortable providing it, then it is appropriate to do so. If the instructor (IoR) feels unable to provide accommodation that satisfies these three criteria or is unsure how the requested accommodation can be provided, the IoR might suggest that the student work with SDS to provide a Letter of Accommodation (LOA).
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 30px">
Face coverings are required. Students are expected to enter the building wearing a face covering and keep it on throughout the class period and when walking through the building afterward. The Texas Tech University System has implemented a mandatory Facial Covering Policy to ensure a safe and healthy classroom experience. Current research on the COVID-19 virus suggests that there is a significant reduction in the potential for transmission of the virus from person to person by wearing a mask/facial covering that covers the nose and mouth areas. Because of the potential for transmission of the virus, and to be consistent with the University’s requirement, students in this class are to wear a mask/facial covering before, during, and after class. Observing safe distancing practices within the classroom by spacing out and wearing a mask/facial covering will greatly improve our odds of having a safe and healthy in-person class experience. Any student choosing not to wear a mask/facial covering during class will be directed to leave the class and will be responsible to make up any missed class content or work.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 30px">
Seating assignments. Students are expected to sit at a minimum of six feet apart. A required seating chart will be created once everyone is positioned with appropriate social distancing. There will also be an orderly procedure, designed to ensure social distancing, for exiting the classroom.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 30px">
Recorded lectures. Given the current situation, lectures may be recorded. Be aware that the video recording may include partial or full view of students in the class along with audio if a question is asked. The recording equipment is set up to capture the professor and their computer setup so anything in that vicinity will appear in the recordings.

        Academic dishonesty, such as cheating or plagiarism, is a serious offense. For the class projects, you are expected to come up with your own design ideas and implement your work. If you are caught cheating, the grade of F will stand as your final grade (see Part II B 2 of the <i>Student Handbook</i>). The instructor may recommend to Student Judicial Programs for more serious/repeated violations. (<i>OP 34.12)</i>
