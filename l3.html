          style="text-decoration: underline;">Direct manipulation</span> -
      originally interacting with a computer was direct manipulation at
      a low level - moving wires, flipping switches. Direct manipulation
      returned in a big way in the 80s (after a lot of basic research
      was done in the 60s and 70s) at a higher user level which could
      involve using a light pen to touch a location on the screen (70s),
      moving a mouse to move a pointer on a screen and clicking the
      mouse button to make selections (80s) to more modern alternatives
      where the user uses a stylus or their finger to more directly
      manipulate the interface itself (2000s).<br> <br>Definition:<br> A human-computer interaction style which involves continuous representation of objects of interest, and rapid, reversible, incremental actions and feedback </p>

      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Natural language</span>
      is commonly used today when getting information via the phone on
      movie times or airline flights or the weather, etc. Services like
      1-800-GOOG-411 were useful from 2007-2010 for users with 'dumb'
      phones, and Siri, Cortona, Google Glass etc. help smart phone
      users, and tools like Alexa have moved that into the home (and
      soon car). 
      <br>
      Voice can be very successful in areas of
      limited/focused vocabulary. 
      <br>More general natural language recognition is harder. <br>
      Talking to your cell phone solves part of the problem of noisy rooms.

  <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">The evolution of the pocket music player is worth
      spending a little time on, showing how capabilities and controls
      evolve together. Physical controls with a simple mapping to their
      function have been evolving into more generic virtual controls .<br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">Transistor Radios - in the mid 1950s a transistor radio
      (back with the word 'transistor' sounded really cool) had
      basically two controls: a knob to turn the radio on/off and
      increase the volume, and a dial to change the station you were
      listening to.<br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;"><img style=" width: 220px; height: 332px;"
                     src="images/radio.jpg" alt="">
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_radio<br>
      <br>
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">Walkman - 20 years later in the late 1970s the move from
      a portable radio, where you could only choose which station you
      could listen to, to being able to choose which cassette tape to
      listen to was a big leap. The physical controls now needed to let
      you eject the cassette, control volume, play, pause, fast-forward,
      rewind. If you had an advanced one you could switch to the other
      side of the tape without taking it out and putting it back in the
      other way, or fast-forward to the beginning of the next song.<br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;"><img style=" width: 301px; height: 370px;"
                     src="images/walkman.gif" alt=""><br>
      http://pocketcalculatorshow.com/walkman/sony/</p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">fast forward another 20 years to the iPod in 2001 and
      the basic controls for playing music on an iPod or similar mp3
      player are not all that different, but now you are carrying much
      more music around with you so there are now more controls to help
      you get to the music you want to play. <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;"><img style=" width: 300px; height: 346px;"
                     src="images/ipod.jpg" alt=""><br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;"><br>
      Within another decade the physical controls would almost
      completely disappear in favor of a touch / multi-touch interface
      and vastly more storage.<br>
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">and now we are at the point where your music is likely
      not even on your person - it is off in the cloud somewhere on an
      internet connected device - where you perhaps have access to 'all'
      music. Now the issues of finding what you want to listen to, or
      might want to listen to, become even more important, especially
      when the same music may have been recorded by different artists,
      or played at different times by the same artist (i.e. pick the
      particular concert you want to hear that song from).<br>
      <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">It is also good to think about the kind of feedback
      these devices give you about their current state. With the
      transistor radio the controls themselves give you feedback on
      their state: the volume knob has numbers on it to tell you how
      loud is, and the frequency dial has numbers to tell you what you
      are tuning into. As you are turning the knobs you get tactile
      feedback and would hear what you are tuning into.<br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">On the Walkman the button you press would push in giving
      tactile feedback, and often you would hear feedback from the
      clicking of the buttons or the whirring of the tape, so you have
      immediate feedback about what mode the device is in. To tell where
      you are in the cassette you could look through the little window
      and see how much tape has already played through. <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">On an iPod all of the feedback, aside from the audio
      itself) is coming to through the LCD screen.<br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">On a modern device all the feedback is coming through a
      very high resolution, very bright, very colourful screen, which
      may be on your phone, or on your wrist, or on your head.</p>

  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">Telephones have gone through similar changes<br>
      <img src="images/telephone1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="360">
      image from Wikipedia<br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">In really early phones which just had a mouthpiece,
      earpiece and a crank:<br>
      1 - lift the receiver<br>
      2 - if no one else is on the line then ring the phone to get the
      operator's attention<br>
      3 - ask the operator to connect you to the number you want<br>
      4 - listen for person to answer<br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">note that this order of operations would continue to be
      the practice for collect calls<br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;"><img src="images/telephone2.jpg" alt="" width="350"
                     height="263"> image from Wikipedia</p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;"> In a classic home phone or public telephone which had
      the addition of a way to enter the number you wanted you would:<br>
      1 - lift the receiver<br>
      2 - listen for the dial tone<br>
      3 - find the number in your memory or a notebook<br>
      4 - dial the number<br>
      5 - listen for person to answer / busy signal / howler / etc<br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:

      a dial on older phones.<br>

  <p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
        sans-serif"> when push button phones were introduced to replace
      the dial phones the layout of the buttons was 'fixed' and has
      remained the same since - notice that it is not the same layout
      for calculators / computer keyboards which are more based on
      cash registers. Bell Labs did user studies to come up with the
      most appropriate numeric phone layout. The numeric layout on
      phones is also better for mapping the alphabet to the numbers
      which allowed for handy mnemonics back in the 20th century.<br>

  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">With cell phones you would:<br>
      1 - check the number of bars you have<br>
      2 - dial the number or select it by scrolling through your
      contacts - your main interface was still an alphanumeric keypad<br>
      3 - press the call button<br>
      4 - listen for person to answer / recording to answer<br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">This initially caused a lot of confusion as the order of
      operations was different<br>
      <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">With a smart phone you could:<br>
      1 - bring up your phone application <br>
      2 - find the person in your previous call list / dial the number
      directly<br>
      etc<br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">1 - bring up your contacts application and find who you
      want to talk to<br>
      2 - press the dial icon on the contacts page<br>
      etc<br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">1 - activate your phones audio interface<br>
      2 - ask your phone to call the person by name (which is pretty
      similar to the very first telephone interface)<br>
      etc</p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">1 - bring up the text conversation that you previously
      had with this person and continue it<br>
      etc<br>

      Another good example is a look back to the olden days of recording
      video. Early VHS Video Cassette Recorders (VCR) in the late 1970s
      had physical controls and the remote control had only a single
      button (pause/play) and was connected by a 20 foot cable. Today
      its almost impossible to use a home video device without the
      remote control.<br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">The controls are broken up into three zones, each with
      different physical controls. The basic controls for turning on the
      device, playing/recording a tape, and recording/playing a tape are
      pretty easy to use and still somewhat familiar today, though the
      commonly used icons had not been invented then. The two big knobs
      for changing the TV channel were very common then and pretty easy
      to use (remember this was before cable TV existed and there was
      just local over the air broadcast on VHF and UHF), and long before
      viewing things on a device connected to the internet.&nbsp; Then
      there was the clock and the timer, which were as difficult to set
      as any digital clock.<br>

  <div style="text-align: justify; font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As with the transistor radio and the
      Walkman the VCR and Tuner controls themselves give you information
      on their current state. Compare this to a modern TiVo type device.
      Interaction is now through a remote-control, rather than the
      physical device itself and feedback is now on the TV/monitor
      screen rather than on the device - the control and the feedback
      are now separate, though one can certainly see a touch-screen
      future where they will come back together on a phone/pad device
      that talks wirelessly to the recording device.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      but we now tend to watch videos through the internet, so if I want
      to watch the latest Zero Punctuation video I now have a smaller
      set of controls which disappear to hide themselves as the video is
      playing. I have play/pause (or click on the screen), a slider to
      pick a specific point in the video, a choice of resolutions,
      mute/not, a volume control, and full screen/not<br>

      and admittedly, this technology looks really ancient these days -
      but at the time, and in the case of the VCR only 40 years ago, it
      was cutting edge for consumer electronics. All of today's
      technology is going to look similarly archaic in a much shorter
      amount of time. The goal here is applying good design principles
      based on the users needs and the current level of technology
      available, and being able to adapt as that level of technology
      changes.<br>
